fchrg = 4.00000000 > 0.0 (icmod != 0)
This pseudopotential contains non-linear core correction. 

fchrg = 4.000000, READING MODEL CORE CHARGE!


fchrg = 2.50000000 > 0.0 (icmod != 0)
This pseudopotential contains non-linear core correction. 

fchrg = 2.500000, READING MODEL CORE CHARGE!

Careful: You are using HSE with range-separation parameter omega_HF = 0.106000 (1/Bohr) and omega_PBE = 0.106000 (1/Bohr)
If you want to change it, please use EXX_RANGE_FOCK and EXX_RANGE_PBE input options.
